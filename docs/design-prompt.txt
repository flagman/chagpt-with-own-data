As an experienced software design architect.
Your task is to design classes for the software described below, and output pythons classes structure using YAML. 
Each yaml description, should include class description, its properties and methods. 

Description: A tool that allows users to query their own data. 
Core components: 
1. Data Sources - downloads data from the  different sources, i.e. wikipedia, pdf file url etc and converts it to text. 
2. Preprocessor - Cleans and preprocess the corpus of data to ensure consistency and remove irrelevant information.
3. Embedding generator - Computes embeddings for each document or text passage in the corpus using  Open AI API . 
4. Vector database storage -  Stores the generated embeddings in a vector database, allowing for efficient similarity searches.
5. Prompt  generator - combines user prompt with relevant text passages to generated chatgpt prompt. 
6. ChatGPT processor - feeds the crafted prompt to ChatGPT and obtain the generated answer.

Sample workflow:
Inputs: pdf url, user query 
1. Using PDFDataDataSource with download pdf from url and convert it to text.
2. Preprocess the text.
3. Using embedding generator split the preprocessed text into chunks of 1000 characters. Generate embeddings for each chunk. Also generate embeddings for the user query. 
4. Store generated text embeddings in the vector database storage. 
5. Using query embedding find similar chunks in the vector database. 
6. Generate chatgpt prompt using found chunks and  user query. 
7. Send the prompt to chat-gpt and get response.
